# Yet another RSS app

A simple RSS app in python that doesn't have sponsored content, ads or other crap.


## Features

Nothing yet. This is a beginner project for me, where I'm learning git, socket, and RSS.


## Known Problems

- Doesn't work on Brave browser
- Non-existant elements on ANY item will cause a crash (to be focused on first)
- Python may keep the port used after throwing an error.


## Installation

1. Have python installed 

https://python.org

2. Clone the repo

`git clone https://github.com/JourneyJ012/yaRSSa`

3. Navigate in

`cd yaRSSa`


## Usage

### start.bat

`./start.bat`

### start.sh

```
chmod +x start.sh
./start.sh
```


## Errors
The reporting system is yet to be needed. Both `start.bat` and `start.sh` only writes the exception to `error.txt` so far. 
The reason this sucks is because the software itself doesn't work yet.
