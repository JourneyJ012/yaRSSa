# Yet another RSS app

A simple RSS app in python that doesn't have sponsored content, ads or other crap.


## Features

Nothing yet. This is a beginner project for me, where I'm learning git, socket, and RSS.

## Known Problems

Doesn't work on Brave browser
Doesn't work, at all.
Python may keep the port used after throwing an error.

## Installation

1. Have python installed 

https://python.org

2. Clone the repo

`git clone https://github.com/JourneyJ012/yaRSSa`

3. Install dependencies

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage

### start.bat
Run the file
### start.sh

```
chmod +x start.sh
./start.sh
```

## Errors
The reporting system is yet to be needed. Both `start.bat` and `start.sh` only writes the exception to `error.txt` so far. 
The reason this sucks is because the software itself doesn't work yet.
